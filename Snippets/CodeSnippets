//Defining a variable
//No need to specify data type. Variable stores the address of the value. Not the actual value.

v1 = 5

//Print the value of a variable to the console

print(v1)

//Operators in Python

The AND operator: and
The OR operator: or

- + / * %

//Division and the result depend on how many slashes you use.

56/5 = 1.2
56//5 = 1

//Printing to console

print("Hello")

//Prints out value of variables plus a string you can add
print(total, "gets added to",num)

//Adding a value to a variable plus itself

a = 5

a+=10 is the same as a = a + 10

//Comments in Python
//Use the # symbol for comments

#THis is a comments and stuff

//Code blocks
//In Python, code blocks begin with a color and are followed by indentation.
//The code block ends when the indendation is reversed. USE INDEDATION CAREFULLY!!!!!!!!!!!!!
//You do not use {} for code blocks in Python indentation is used instead

num = 1234

if(num < 10):
  print("Hello") 

print("Outside code block")

//If-else-then
//The indentation determines when if ends and where else starts

if(False):
  print("Hello")

else:
  print("not Hello")

print("outside of Code")

//USE THE elif INSTEAD OF ELSE IF!!!!!!!!!!!!!

if(num>0):
  print("45")
  print("65")

elif(num<0):
    
  print("-45")
  print("-65 ")
  
elif(num==0):
    print("ZERO")


//Or And operators
//Use the word (or) and the word (and) instead of && ||

if(num>0 or num==0):
  print("45")
  print("65")

elif(:
  print("-45")
  print("-65 ")

//While loop
//Similar to java. Just remember the indetation stuff

num = 5;

while (num > 0):
    print(num)
    num = num-1
    
//Methods
//Use the def keyword in order to define a method in Python. They are not read unless they are directly called

def calculate_sum(data1, data2):
    
    result_sum=data1+data2
    return result_sum

result=calculate_sum(10,20)
print(result)
    

//Multiline string
//THis string includes the newline values meaning that if you print it, it will have skip lines 

a = '''Gekki
asdfasd
asdfasdf
asdfasdfdaf'''

print(a)

//Get input from the user!!!

name=input("Enter your name:")
print(name)

//Convert input from String to integer
//Input received from input function is String by default

number = input("Enter a number:")
number = int(number)
print(number)
